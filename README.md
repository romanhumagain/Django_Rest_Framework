<h1>Learning Django Rest Framework and Postman Testing</h1>

<p>This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning the Django REST framework and testing APIs with Postman. The main goal of this project is to understand the fundamental concepts of creating a RESTful API using Django and subsequently testing these APIs using Postman.</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. In this project, I will be developing an API from scratch using the Django REST framework, creating endpoints for various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The API will then be tested using Postman, a popular API client. Along the way, I'll focus on best practices for structuring and implementing code.</p>
